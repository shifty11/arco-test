## Development

### Prerequisites

Before building or developing Arco, you need to install the following:

1. [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) - Programming language
2. [Wails v3](https://v3alpha.wails.io/) - Framework for building desktop applications with Go and web technologies
   ```bash
   # You can install Wails v3 system-wide (or you just use go tool wails3)
   go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@latest
   ```
3. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) - Package manager for the frontend
4. [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) - Task runner used to build and develop Arco
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install go-task/tap/go-task
   
   # Linux
   sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin
   ```

### Building

To build a redistributable, run the following command in the project directory:
```bash
task build
```

This will build both the frontend and backend, and package the application for your platform.

### Live Development

To run in live development mode, run:
```bash
task dev
```

This will run a Vite development server that provides fast hot reload of your frontend changes. The backend will also automatically rebuild when you make changes to the Go code.

For frontend-only development, you can run:
```bash
task dev:frontend
```

### Additional Commands

For more development commands, see the [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) file, which contains a comprehensive list of all available commands for building, testing, and developing Arco.
